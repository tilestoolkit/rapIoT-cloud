                    Even though this step is optional, it is higly recommended in order to simplify the development process for
                    <i>non-experts</i> using the extended toolkit. The TILES Cards is an ideation process that has been tested
                    and tailored to help people with little experience with programming and IoT to develop ideas for IoT
                    applications. Following this final step of the TEP will provide non-experts with only those cards that
                    are supported by your extended TILES toolkit, which will remove potential deadlocks and errors made by
                    non-expert developers.
