                <h2>Development environments</h2>
                <p>
                    This section of the documentation is inteded to help you decide which development environment you should use to develop your
                    application. It will briefly explain the differences between the available environments and what prerequisits
                    are needed for using them. This section will <b>not</b> go into details about how
                    to develop TILES applications using the APIs of the development environments. For that purpose, see the
                    documentation on the respective API of the development environment in question. If this is your first
                    time developing a TILES application, we suggest the
                    <b>Cloud Development Environment</b>.
                </p>
                <h3>Cloud development environment</h3>
                <p>
                    The Cloud development environment is running a <a href="https://c9.io/">cloud9</a> web portal as your
                    IDE. When the Cloud development environment is selected for developing a TILES application, the TILES
                    API library files are created and the IDE is configured automatically. The cloud9 IDE will be running
                    in the browser, which means that no local setup is required, and you can run the development environment
                    using your favorite operating system and web browser. Once the environment is created, you will be developing
                    your application using JavaScript, and the TILES toolkit <a href="{{JSdevUrl}}">JavaScript APIs</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start the development environment, navigate to the
                    <a href="/#/applications">list of applications</a> and select your application. In the application details
                    page you will need to click the <b>Host application</b> button, which will start a new instance of the
                    cloud9 web IDE and display the <b>Workspace URL</b> to the IDE as seen in the image below.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-startstop-cloud-ide.png" alt="start_stop_cloud_web_ide" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>Start hosting of the cloud9 web IDE for the application</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once the workspace environment has been hosted, you can access the IDE by navigating to the URL displayed in the application
                    page.
                </p>
                <div class="docs-img opacity75">
                    <img src="/images/howto/howto-cloud9-ide.png" alt="cloud9_web_ide" />
                    <br/>
                    <span>Cloud9 web IDE configured with TILES JavaScript API</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the cloud workspace you will find two files:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>template-API.js</b> - Shows code examples and API instructions</li>
                        <li><b>tiles.js</b> - Empty file where you will write your own application code</li>
                    </ol>
                    In addition to programming the application, you will be able to select your code file, and hit 'Run' in the IDE. This will
                    start the program code in debug mode, and you will be able to see the output of your program in the bash
                    window. This way you are able to properly debug your application code directly in the Cloud IDE during
                    development. For more detaile instructions, please read through the section for
                    <a href="#/docs-app0">Application Development Process</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>Local development environment</h3>
                <p>
                    When you select the Local development environment, you will have to download the JavaScript APIs with all its files and store
                    them locally on your development machine. The local environment is intended for experienced users only
                    and might be difficult for non-experts to properly set up. Make sure that you have installed npm and
                    NodeJS on your system before staring. NodeJS and npm can be downloaded
                    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>. To download the APIs and start developing, follow
                    these steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Open your applicaiton from the <a href="/#/applications">list of applications</a> and click
                            <b>Download API</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>Unzip the file on your computer and notice the file structure of the API:
                            <div class="tree-wrapper">
                                <ul class="tree">
                                    <li class="dir">api
                                        <ul>
                                            <li class="dir">clients
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>event-reader.js</li>
                                                    <li>hue-client.js</li>
                                                    <li>ifttt-client.js</li>
                                                    <li>postman-client.js</li>
                                                    <li>tiles-client.js</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>api-client.js</li>
                                            <li>package.json</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="dir">templates
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>template-API.js</li>
                                            <li>tiles.js</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Open the <b>api</b> directory with your Command-line interface, and type <b>npm install</b> to
                            install all required node packages
                        </li>
                        <li>Open the <b>tiles.js</b> file in the <b>templates</b> directory and change the following:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>{{tilesLibHolder}<!--escape angular-->}</b> - replace with '../api'</li>
                            <li><b>{{userNameHolder}<!--escape angular-->}</b> - replace with application owner of the target
                                application
                            </li>
                            <li><b>{{appNameHolder}<!--escape angular-->}</b> - replace with name of the target application</li>
                            <li><b>{{ipAddressHolder}<!--escape angular-->}</b> - replace with IP address of TILES Cloud server</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    If everything went well, you will now be ready to start developing your application. With the Local development environment,
                    you will be writing your application code in JavaScript (similar to Cloud development environment). Once
                    you have downloaded the API, you are free to select any IDE you want for writing the code. Using this
                    development environment requires more set up as detailed above, but once it is properly configured you
                    will have access to the source code of the entire
                    <a href="{{JSdevUrl}}">TILES JS API</a>, and you will be able to integrate your TILES application into
                    any application running NodeJS.
                </p>

                <hr/>

                <h3>Rule Engine development environment</h3>
                <p>
                    Similarly to the Cloud development environment, the Rule Engine is hosted in the TILES Cloud web portal with no need for
                    any local setup. When selecting your app from the
                    <a href="/#/applications">list of applications</a> you will notice some differences in the application
                    page from the Cloud and Local Development Environments. With this environment you do not need to open
                    an external IDE or download the APIs and run them locally, but you will be able to develop your application
                    directly in the application page. Please see <a href="{{REdevUrl}}">Rule Engine API</a> for instructions
                    on how to develop applications with the Rule Engine Development Environment.
                </p>
